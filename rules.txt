:no_entry_sign:1. No swearing, at all unless in official nsfw channel. Ever.  We have a automatic system in place and it will delete your message if it contains swearing. If the bot fails the mods will

:no_entry_sign:2. The voice chat might not always be PG, please keep this in mind that we cannot keep voice chat always clean but if you catch someone swearing please alert a mod about it so we can take action!

:no_entry_sign:3. There will be ZERO tolerance for bullying if we hear about anyone being bullied on this discord we will take administrative action!

:no_entry_sign:4. No explicit photos/memes unless in nsfw channel, these will also earn you a ban.

:no_entry_sign:5. Have fun; this server is for everyone to meet new friends.

:no_entry_sign:6. Always be nice.

:no_entry_sign:7. Do not spam. Medium length walls of text are ok as long as they are a paragraph and not the same word over and over again

:no_entry_sign:8. Do not attempt to impersonate any Admins or Mods, if found doing this it will result in a perm ban from this discord server.

:no_entry_sign:9. Don't tag admins unless your life is in danger! Admins are very busy people and when they see a tag, they might think it's very important to drop everything they are doing. Please look to the mods before looking for a admin!

:no_entry_sign:10. No advertising other discords, youtube channels, or anything that is not related to the Exotic group!

:no_entry_sign:11. No using voice changers in the voice chats!

:no_entry_sign:12. No singing or playing music in the voice chats. This server is PG and as we can't have our moderation team in every voice chat 24/7 we can't control what songs will be played and thus ask people to just not play any!
